    <p>
        Hello, my name is Victor Diaz Hernandez. As a recent computer science associate graduate with a passion for
        technology and problem-solving, I am eager to
        launch my career in software engineering. I bring 10+ years of experience in customer service and sales to the
        table, and I am bilingual in Spanish. I have honed my technical skills through an internship at Mutual of Omaha,
        where I worked on various projects, from helping with the development of AWS applications to debugging code.
    </p>

    <p>In addition to my technical abilities, I am a strong collaborator and communicator. My background in customer
        service and sales has taught me the importance of clear, effective communication, and I have a proven track
        record of working well in teams. My combination of technical skills, interpersonal skills, and customer-focused
        experience make me a valuable asset to any software development team.
    </p>

    <p>I am excited to explore new opportunities in the software engineering field and am open to considering a variety
        of roles. I look forward to connecting with professionals in the industry and growing my network.
    </p>
